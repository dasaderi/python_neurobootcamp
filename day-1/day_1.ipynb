    "## What is Python? \n",
    "Python is a widely used programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is an *interpreted* language, meaning that it will read your code, line-by-line, and \"translate\" it into binary (compile) every time it's run. In contrast, *compiled* languages require you to write the full program first before running it. While compiled languages generally run faster, interpreted languages can often approach the speed of compiled languages with proper use of third-party libraries. One advantage of interpreted languages is that you can use an interactive prompt to execute single lines of code and view the results immediately. This allows you to write and test, line by line, your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python emphasizes code readability and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. \n",
    "Writing \"*Pythonian*\" code means writing clear, documented code that other people (and you in six months) will understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this bootcamp is to introduce you to Python by working through some neuro data sets that we selected based on your interests. But before we jump into hands-on analysis, we will go quickly through some basic concepts of Python programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "** A quick note about Python versions. ** Python has a few different versions available. The most common ones are Version 2 and Version 3. There are a few key differences between these versions which can cause usability issues (*i.e.*, some code written for Python 3 won't run with Python 2 without revisions). **This course is using Python 3.** We will provide some additional resources and information about version 2 on Day 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Python's main strengths and why did we choose it for this course?\n",
    "- Python is FREE!\n",
    "- Python is becoming the *de facto* standard programming language in Neuroscience.\n",
    "- There is a lot of support online, and it is easy to find an answer to your questions just by Googling it.\n",
    "- It is designed to be readable (if you write it to be so!) \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Jupyter Notebook and why are we using it for this course?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter Notebook, a space where you can combine text (this is [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)) and code. It is an awesome educational tool! The best part is that you will be able to interact with anything that is written here, test out code, take notes, and make it your own.\n",
