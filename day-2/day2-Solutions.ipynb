    "Welcome to Day 2! Python programmers often organize their code into chunks called modules. A module contains a set of related commands to accomplish a task. Today we are going to learn two of the most useful modules for data manipulation and plotting, `pandas` and `seaborn`. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first module we'll load is the `pandas` module, which will let us manipulate 2D tables. We refer to the `pandas` module here as `pd` as an abbreviation. The second module we load is the `numpy` module, mostly for the arithmetic functions built into it. We will do much more with the `numpy` module in Days 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load a module using `import`, all of the functions available, such as `np.mean` are now accessible to you. Modules and import statements help programmers avoid naming conflicts because you can use short, straightforward names for functions and variables without worrying that they're already taken. Matlab does not have anything equivalent to Python's module system and therefore can be harder to read. \n",

    "Faceting is one of the most powerful ways of exploring data. For example, we can see whether there is a `Strain` by `Sex` effect by producing *conditional* boxplots, which separate the data out by condition. This kind of visualization can be critical when exploring the data and looking for conditional effects. For example, we may notice a difference between Strains only for females, and not males.  \n",
